### To create a S3 static hosting

```ts
import * as cdk from "@aws-cdk/core";
import * as s3 from "@aws-cdk/aws-s3";

export class AwsCdk101Stack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // init bucket
    const siteBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, "nicole-s3-demo", {
      bucketName: "nicole-s3-demo",
      websiteIndexDocument: "index.html",
      websiteErrorDocument: "error.html",
      publicReadAccess: true,

      // The default removal policy is RETAIN, which means that cdk destroy will not attempt to delete
      // the new bucket, and it will remain in your account until manually deleted. By setting the policy to
      // DESTROY, cdk destroy will attempt to delete the bucket, but will error if the bucket is not empty.
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, // NOT recommended for production code
    });
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "websiteBucketName", {
      value: siteBucket.bucketName,
    });
  }
}
```
